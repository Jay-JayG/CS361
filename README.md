1. Instructions on How to Request Data from the Microservice:

The microservice is an .exe executable file which means that its communication pipeline for requesting data can be done through subprocesws calls or system calls.

The following is text in a python program that would call the .exe:

#Obtaining path to executable
cwd = os.getcwd()
program = cwd + "/text_editing_program.exe"

#Call to Microservice
os.startfile(program)


2. Instructions on How to Request Data from the Microservice:

The microservice is an inplace text editing program, meaning it will modify the contents of text files and save thoes changes to the same text file in the same location that text file was located.

This means that to recieve the data generated by this microservice the user must access the textfile wherever it was located.

For example in python:

#Call to Microservice
os.startfile(program)

#Code that reads data generated by microservice.
def read_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        contents = file.read()
    return contents
